Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has [X] products in the [Category] space.

Quick question: How do you currently track competitor pricing
across all your SKUs?

Most companies we work with either:
1. Do it manually (time-consuming)
2. Don't do it at all (missed opportunities)

We've helped similar companies in [Industry] save 10+ hours/week
and increase margins by 12% on average.

Worth a quick chat?

Best,
